A manifest file is a metadata file that describes the contents, configuration, permissions, and dependencies of a software package, application, or project.

Before the Android OS runs an app, it reads this file to understand:

- Who the app is (Package Name).
- What the app can do (Permissions).
- Which screens and background tasks exist (Components).
- How the app interacts with the system and other apps.

**Location:**
**Source Code:** Found in the root of the src/main/ folder.
**Compiled APK:** Found in the root of the APK file (encoded in binary XML).
