A partition is a separate section of storage with its own filesystem.

```
Your Phone's 128GB Storage
├── /boot         → 64MB
├── /system       → 4GB
├── /vendor       → 1GB
├── /userdata     → 120GB
└── /recovery     → 64MB
```
Each partition is mounted separately and has different permissions.

**System Partition:**
- Contains the core Android OS (AOSP)
- Houses system apps, framework, and core libraries
- Typically read-only in production devices
- Can be updated via OTA updates
