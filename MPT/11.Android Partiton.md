A partition is a separate section of storage with its own filesystem.

```
Your Phone's 128GB Storage
├── /boot         → 64MB
├── /system       → 4GB
├── /vendor       → 1GB
├── /userdata     → 120GB
└── /recovery     → 64MB
```
Each partition is mounted separately and has different permissions.


## System Partition:

- Contains the core Android OS (AOSP)
- Houses system apps, framework, and core libraries
- Typically read-only in production devices
- Can be updated via OTA updates

```

└── etc/                 # Configuration files
```
- **Android Framework:** The .jar files that run the logic of the OS (Activity Manager, Package Manager).
- **System Apps:** Calculator, Settings, Phone (Privileged apps).
- **Native Libraries:** Common shared libraries (libc.so, libssl.so).
- **APEX Modules:** (Important!) In modern Android, system components (like the Media Codecs or ADB) are packaged as .apex files here. They can be updated via Google Play without a full OS update.

## 2. The Vendor Partition (/vendor):
- **HALs (Hardware Abstraction Layers):** Binaries that talk to the kernel drivers. In 2026, these strictly use AIDL (Android Interface Definition Language). The older HIDL standard is dead.
- **Proprietary Blobs:** Closed-source binaries from Qualcomm, MediaTek, or the OEM.
- **VNDK (Vendor Native Development Kit):** Libraries specifically allowing the Vendor partition to talk to the System partition without breaking compatibility.


## 3.Non-Updatable (Firmware, Bootloader & TEE)
- **ABL/XBL (Bootloaders):** The code that initializes the CPU and RAM before Android starts.
- **TrustZone / TEE (The Secure World):** This is a separate OS running alongside Android on the same CPU but isolated. It handles encryption keys, Biometrics, and DRM.
- **vbmeta: The Verified Boot metadata.** This ensures nobody has modified the partitions.
