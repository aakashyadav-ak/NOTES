## Shared Preference

In Android development, Shared Preferences is a mechanism that allows developers to save small amounts of primitive data (like settings, flags, or high scores) as key-value pairs.

1. The Android OS creates an XML file in the app's private directory to store this data.
2.  These files are typically located at:
     /data/data/<package_name>/shared_prefs/<filename>.xml

- Developers often make the mistake of storing sensitive information (like passwords, API keys, or session tokens) in SharedPreferences in plain text (unencrypted). If an attacker gains access to the device (physically or via malware with root access), they can easily read these secrets.
