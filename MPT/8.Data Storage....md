# OWASP Mobile Top 10: M2 - Insecure Data Storage
## Shared Preference

Shared Preferences is an Android API used to store small collections of primitive data (booleans, floats, ints, longs, strings) in key-value pairs.

**The vulnerability exists when developers store sensitive information (PII, Passwords, API Tokens, Session IDs) in Shared Preferences without implementing encryption. If an attacker gains physical access to an unlocked device, uses a malicious app with root privileges, or dumps the filesystem, they can read this data in plain text.**

1. **Working:** The Android OS creates an ==XML== file in the app's private directory to store this data.
2. **Path:** These files are typically located at:
```
    /data/data/<package_name>/shared_prefs/<filename>.xml
```

**Vulnerability:** Developers often make the mistake of storing sensitive information (like passwords, API keys, or session tokens) in Shared Preferences in plain text (unencrypted). If an attacker gains access to the device (physically or via malware with root access), they can easily read these secrets.
