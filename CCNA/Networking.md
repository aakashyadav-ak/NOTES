## 1.IP(internet protocol)

- A unique address that identifies a device on the internet or on a local network.
- Logical address 
- An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication.


#####  we can change(assign) a IP dynamically/statically

**Dynamic IP:**
A dynamic IP address is assigned to a device temporarily by a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. The address can change over time, especially when the device reconnects to the network or after a lease period expires.

ex=home networks, corporate environments

**Static IP:**
A static IP address is manually assigned to a device and does not change over time. It remains constant until it is manually changed by a network administrator.

ex=servers, network printers

### Types of IP Address

- IPv4 
- IPv6
#### IPv4 

IPv4: A 32-bit address, typically represented in decimal format as 4 octets (e.g., 192.168.1.1). It allows for approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses.

```
         Dotted Decimal Notation
         
          192 . 168 .  1  .  10
           |     |     |     |
        Octet  Octet Octet Octet
        
Each octet = 8 bits = 1 byte
Total = 32 bits
```

```
Decimal:    192    .   168    .    1     .    10
Binary:   11000000 . 10101000 . 00000001 . 00001010
```

(One Octate is from 0-255)

- It has Unicast, Multicast and Broadcast style of address.
- by default it broadcast if destination is not found.

**HOST:**
 A host in IPv4 is any device assigned an IP address within a subnet, and the number of possible       hosts is determined by the host bits in the subnet mask: 2^host bits (24,16,8)-2.

##### IPv4 class

| Class | First Octet Range | Default Subnet Mask | Networks  | Hosts per Network |
| :---- | :---------------- | :------------------ | :-------- | :---------------- |
| **A** | 1 - 126           | 255.0.0.0 (/8)      | 126       | ~16 million       |
| **B** | 128 - 191         | 255.255.0.0 (/16)   | 16,384    | ~65,000           |
| **C** | 192 - 223         | 255.255.255.0 (/24) | 2 million | 254               |
| **D** | 224 - 239         | Multicast           | -         | -                 |
| **E** | 240 - 255         | Experimental        | -         | -                 |
1. **Class A**
class a= 1.0.0.0-126.255.255.255  (Number of Networks: 126 (0 to 127)
- Network bits = 8, Host bits = 24
- Number of hosts = 2^24−2=16,777,214 
- Default mask: 255.0.0.0 (/8)

1 octet range= 1-126.
==0 and 127 are reserved. 0.x.x.x refers to the default route and 127.x.x.x is the special loopback range for localhost.==

- ==1.0.0.0 & 1.2.0.0 both are same network==
- ==10.0.0.0 & 11.0.0.0 both are different network.==


2. **Class B**
class b= 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255 (Number of Networks: 16,384)
- Network bits = 16, Host bits = 16
- Number of hosts = 2^16−2=65,534
- Default mask: 255.255.0.0 (/16)

1 octet range= 128-191
2 octet range= 0-255

3. Class C

class c= 192.0.0.0 – 223.255.255.255
- Network bits = 24, Host bits = 8
- Number of hosts = 2^8−2=254
- Default mask: 255.255.255.0 (/8)

1 octet range= 192-223
2 octet range= 0-255
3 octet range= 0-255.


==Mostly IP Network belong to class c/192 because it has more no. of networks and less no of host== 
==network=2097152==
==host=256==


5. **class d**=   224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255 (Multicast, no hosts)
6. **class e**=   240.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255 (Experimental, no hosts)

#### IPv6:
**IPv6:** A 128-bit address, represented in hexadecimal format (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). 
It was developed to address the limitations of IPv4 and allows for a vastly larger number of unique addresses.


**IANA** = Internet Assigned Numbers Authority

It’s a department of ICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).

**IANA manages:**
- IP addresses: coordinates global IPv4 and IPv6 address space.  
- Protocol numbers & ports: e.g., TCP port 80 = HTTP, UDP port 53 = DNS.


##### Reserved IP address
- 0.0.0.0 - default route (everywhere).
- 255.255.255.255 - default broadcast
- 127.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255 - local host/loopback address (used for troubleshooting)/(NIC card testing)
- 169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255 (APIPA Range) when DHCP fails to provide IP to a device.


##### Public IP address

- Used on the Internet — can be reached globally.  
- Assigned by ISPs (Internet Service Providers).  
- Must be unique across the whole Internet.  
Think of it like your home address — anyone in the world can send data to it.


Private IP address(Router/switch private IP address)

Used inside local networks (like home, office, or lab).  
Cannot be routed on the Internet.  
Used to identify devices within your LAN (Local Area Network).  
Think of it like room numbers inside your house — used only internally.

### MAC Address

**Media Access Control Address/Physical Address**:
A globally unique 48 bit hardware no. of a hardware device embedded into a network card known as NIC, during the time of manufacturing.


ex=00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E(hexadecimal format)

- First 24 bits (first 3 bytes) → OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier), identifies the manufacturer.  
- Last 24 bits (last 3 bytes) → device-specific part (unique per NIC).


**IEEE** 
- IEEE = Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.  
- It’s the body that sets many networking standards (Ethernet = IEEE 802.3, Wi-Fi = IEEE 802.11). 
- For MAC addresses, IEEE manages the OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) space.
- 
it manages allocation of MAC addresses known as MAC-48 & now called EUI-48 identifiers.
