Intent is a messaging object used for communication between Android components. It requests an action from another app component like starting an activity, service, or delivering a broadcast.  

In the Android world, components (Activities, Services) don't talk to each other directly. Instead, they create an Intent (an envelope), put some instructions and data inside it, and hand it to the Android OS. The OS then delivers that message to the correct destination.

It is used for:
- **Starting an Activity:** (e.g., clicking a button to go from Screen A to Screen B).
- **Starting a Service:** (e.g., telling the app to start downloading a file in the background).
- **Broadcasting a Message:** (e.g., The system telling all apps: "The battery is low" or "WiFi is connected").

Intents are critical attack vectors for inter-process communication vulnerabilities.
